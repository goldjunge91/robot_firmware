## Hardware Testing Procedure

### Prerequisites
1. Raspberry Pi Pico connected via USB
2. Micro-ROS agent running on host/Raspberry Pi
3. Robot in safe testing environment
4. Serial monitor connected (optional but recommended)

### Step-by-Step Testing

#### Phase 1: Flash and Boot (5 minutes)
```bash
# Flash the firmware
make flash-release

# Or manually copy
cp releases/my_firmware_release_latest.uf2 /Volumes/RPI-RP2/
```

**Expected Results:**
- Pico reboots automatically
- LED blinks indicating activity
- Serial output shows agent initialization
- All agents start successfully

#### Phase 2: Connection Test (5 minutes)
```bash
# On host/Raspberry Pi, start micro-ROS agent
ros2 run micro_ros_agent micro_ros_agent serial --dev /dev/ttyACM0

# In another terminal, verify topics
ros2 topic list

# Run health check
./monitor_health.sh
```

**Expected Results:**
- Pico connects to micro-ROS agent
- Topics appear: `/cmd_vel`, `/imu/data_raw`, `/joint_states`, `/odom`
- Health monitor shows all checks passing

#### Phase 3: Motor Control Test (10 minutes)
```bash
# Test forward
ros2 topic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist \
  "{linear: {x: 0.1, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}}" --once

# Test backward
ros2 topic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist \
  "{linear: {x: -0.1, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}}" --once

# Test strafe left
ros2 topic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist \
  "{linear: {x: 0.0, y: 0.1, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}}" --once

# Test strafe right
ros2 topic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist \
  "{linear: {x: 0.0, y: -0.1, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}}" --once

# Test rotation
ros2 topic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist \
  "{linear: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.5}}" --once

# Test combined
ros2 topic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist \
  "{linear: {x: 0.1, y: 0.05, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.2}}" --once

# Stop
ros2 topic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist \
  "{linear: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}}" --once
```

**Expected Results:**
- Robot responds to all movement commands
- Motors engage within 100ms
- Movement is smooth and controlled
- PID maintains target speeds
- Encoder feedback visible in `/joint_states`

#### Phase 4: Sensor Verification (10 minutes)
```bash
# Check IMU rate
ros2 topic hz /imu/data_raw
# Expected: ~100 Hz

# View IMU data
ros2 topic echo /imu/data_raw
# Expected: Reasonable acceleration (~9.8 m/s² on Z), near-zero gyro when stationary

# Check odometry
ros2 topic echo /odom
# Expected: Position starts at origin, updates during movement

# Monitor joint states
ros2 topic echo /joint_states
# Expected: Encoder positions and velocities update
```

**Expected Results:**
- IMU publishes at ~100 Hz
- Acceleration shows gravity when stationary
- Odometry tracks position and orientation
- Joint states show encoder feedback

#### Phase 5: Stress Test (30 minutes)
```bash
# Run automated stress test
./stress_test.sh

# In another terminal, monitor health
watch -n 5 ./monitor_health.sh
```

**Expected Results:**
- Test completes full 30 minutes
- No micro-ROS disconnections
- All topics continue publishing
- Motor control remains responsive
- No errors in serial output
- Stack usage remains healthy
