**Feature**: Logging Mechanism Integration
**Date**: 2025-09-25
**Source**: research.md

## Test Objective

Verify that the logging system properly captures and outputs system events and debug information.

## Test Cases

### Debug Logging

- Enable debug mode
- Send various commands
- Verify debug messages appear in output
- Check log levels and formatting

### Error Logging

- Trigger error conditions (sensor failures, invalid commands)
- Verify error messages are logged
- Check error context and timestamps

### Performance Logging

- Monitor logging overhead
- Verify logging doesn't impact real-time performance
- Check log output rates

## Pass Criteria

- All system events are properly logged
- Log levels work correctly
- Performance impact is minimal
